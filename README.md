# README
This repo facilitates the replication of my paper titled "Benefits and Costs of Dual and Informal
Apprenticeship in BÃ©nin". 

# Prerequisites
Stata, SPSS, and R (preferably RStudio) are necessary to fully reproduce paper.

The following default path is used in the scripts below: 

"/Volumes/nadel/research/Data/PhDs/Bart 2022/Paper 3 - CQP"

If data is copied into a different directory, path names have to be adjusted where indicated below.

# Replication

The paper can be replicated from raw data in three steps, executed in the following order:

  1. **open Stata do file "master.do" in the root folder, enter new user path if needed and run**
  2. **open SPSS syntax "master.sps" in the root folder, enter new user path if needed and run**
  3. **open R script "master.R" in the root folder, enter new user path if needed and run**

The final step generates a PDF called "cnb_apprenticeship.pdf" in the "markdown" folder. This is the replicated paper.

If you have any questions about replicating this paper, please see comments in the scripts above or contact the author at bartlomiej.kudrzycki[at]nadel.ethz.ch
